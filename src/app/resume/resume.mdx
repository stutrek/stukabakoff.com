## Work History

### Founding Engineer @ [Eraser Labs, Inc.](https://eraser.io)

_February 2022 - September 2024_

Eraser is a tool for whiteboarding and documentation. The essence of it is a document editor next to a canvas, with integrations going both ways. I was primarily responsible for many parts of the app, and played a role in almost all parts.

-   Developed advanced “diagram as code” features with sophisticated visual layouts for cloud architectures, databases, flowcharts, and sequence diagrams.
-   Implemented a real-time syncing rich text editor using SlateJS and Firebase, enhancing collaborative editing capabilities.
-   Optimized high-level architecture to reduce costs and latency, bringing 50th percentile latency down 80%.
-   Introduced end-to-end testing and visual snapshot testing.
-   Created AI prompts, frameworks, and workflows for generating diagrams from text, streamlining development and user workflows.
-   Resolved complex issues related to memory usage, text rendering, and canvas performance, resulting in smoother, sharper user experiences.
-   Addressed challenges with z-indexing, syncing, and latency during data synchronization on the canvas.
-   Developed a VSCode extension to render diagrams from code, putting our product where developers already are.
-   Implemented a language server and architecture enabling GUI-based modifications to “diagram as code,” making edits much easier and more natural.

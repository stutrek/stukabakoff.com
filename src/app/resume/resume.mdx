## Work History

### Founding Engineer @ [Eraser Labs, Inc.](https://eraser.io)

_February 2022 - September 2024_

Eraser is a tool for whiteboarding and documentation, the essence of it is a document editor next to a canvas, with integrations going both ways. It has diagram as code features similar to Mermaid. I played a part in nearly every part of the app.

-   Created algorithmic guarantees around z-indexing in O(n) time (text and bound arrows must be over boxes, groups, figures).
-   Implemented an O(n) algorithm to combine overlapping text features (bold, color, selections, links) to enable syntax highlighting.
-   Devised an algorithm to divide the whitespace on the canvas into a graph, allowing arrow routing using Djkstra's algorithm.
-   Implemented canvas-based keyboard navigation with weights for distance and direction in O(n log n) time.
-   Implemented syncing text editor using changesets.
-   Developed advanced “diagram as code” features with sophisticated visual layouts for cloud architectures, databases, flowcharts, and sequence diagrams.
-   Algorithmically straightened lines and reduced crossings in output from GraphViz.
-   Optimized high-level architecture to reduce costs and latency, bringing 50th percentile latency down 80%.
-   Introduced end-to-end testing and visual snapshot testing.
-   Created AI prompts, frameworks, and workflows for generating diagrams from text, streamlining development and user workflows.
-   Resolved complex issues related to memory usage, text rendering, and canvas performance, resulting in smoother, sharper user experiences.
-   Addressed challenges with z-indexing, syncing, and latency during data synchronization on the canvas.
-   Developed a VSCode extension to render diagrams from code, putting our product where developers already are.
-   Implemented a language server and architecture enabling GUI-based modifications to diagram as code, making edits much easier and more natural.

### Principal Engineer in Provider Services @ [Zocdoc, Inc](https://zocdoc.com)

_August 2021 - February 2022_

I loved the culture and technology at Zocdoc, but left because of Eraser's innovative product vision.

-   Mentored a dozen engineers through direct interaction, presentations, writing and reviewing tech docs.
-   Led the migration from a microrepo to a monorepo architecture, improving code maintainability and deployment efficiency.
-   Wrote git scripts to preserve GitHub PR links in commit messages to the monorepo.
-   Created a streamlined onboarding process for doctors joining Zocdoc.

### Tech Lead / IC5 in 911 Dispatch Software @ [Mark43, Inc](https://mark43.com)

_November 2018 - July 2021_

Mark43 develops software for police departments worldwide, including real-time 911 dispatch applications used in dispatch centers and police vehicles.

-   Improved speed and GC pauses by switching many loops from O(n log n) to O(n).
-   Mentored a team of 12 front-end developers, with a focus on professional growth and enhancing code quality.
-   Championed, designed, and implemented a new data layer for real-time updates using WebSockets, Web Workers, IndexedDB, and Broadcast Channel, reducing network load by over 70% while maintaining backward compatibility.
-   Developed new APIs for data access, ensuring data consistency and reliability in real-time operations.
-   Authored comprehensive documentation, enabling other engineers to independently learn and modify the system.

_September 2014 - October 2018_

-   Created and implemented an O(n) algorithm for determining the density of points visible on a map.
-   Created an O(n) algorithm for bucketing data points on a graph.
-   Created a data layer that would find and load chunks of uncached data for virtualized lists.
-   Led the development of the flagship React/Redux application, overseeing architecture and feature implementation.
-   Engineered systems capable of handling tens of thousands of data points on maps, tables, and graphs with smooth animations.
-   Created embeddable widgets for third-party websites using shared components from flagship apps.
-   Built front-end build processes, testing frameworks, and continuous integration systems.
-   Reviewed all front-end code and frequently served as functional team lead for development projects.
